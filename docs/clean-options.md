# Options

## force
Type: `Boolean`  
Default: false

This overrides `grunt.file.delete` from blocking deletion of folders outside current working dir (CWD). Use with caution.

## quiet
Type: `Boolean`  
Default: false

This suppresses the output so that only the number of items that were removed is logged.
